# Introduction-to-Web-Design-Final-Project
For this Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth course (Introduction to Web Development), I was instructed to develop a mock website for a bakery. The project uses HTML and CSS. There are 4 main pages on this website. 

The "home page" displays new and important information to site visitors. The top of the home page displays some basic information about the bakery, like the phone number of the shop, the location, and the hours they are open. It also displays 3 cakes that the shop is well known for. The rest of the home page displays information about the bakery's purpose and some customer reviews. There are videos and gifs alongside these parts of the main content area.

The "order" page allows the user to order either speciality cakes or customizable cakes. At the top of this page, there is a table listing the possible cake sizes, the amount of servings for each cake size, and the prices. Next, there is a form that site visitors must fill out so that the bakery can contact them when their cake is ready to be picked up. Then, users can pick between a speciality cake or a customizable cake. For the customizable cake, the customers can choose flavors, frosting, and toppings.

The "contact us" page features a form that the site visitor can fill out so that the bakery can get back to them with their questions. The information submitted in this form is not sent anywhere.

The "source" page lists out the sources from media used in this project in a table format.
